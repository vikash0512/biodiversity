            The Living Planet Index looks at 32,000 populations of 5,230 animal species across the globe.

            In the most comprehensive index to date, tracking the health of nature over 50 years, WWF and the ZSL
            (Zoological Society of London) Institute of Zoology, find an average 69% decline in wildlife populations
            around
            the world between 1970 and 2018.

            But the extent of decline varies in different parts of the world and between species, with Latin America
            showing
            the greatest regional decline in average population abundance at 94%, while freshwater species populations
            have
            seen the greatest overall global decline (83%), according to the report.

            A two-thirds drop in abundance refers to a significant decline in the number of individuals of a particular
            species or group of species. It means that the population size has decreased by approximately 66% from its
            previous levels. Such a decline in abundance can have far-reaching consequences for ecosystems and the
            services they provide to humans.

            There are many factors that can contribute to a two-thirds drop in abundance, including habitat loss and
            fragmentation, overexploitation, climate change, pollution, invasive species, and disease. For example,
            habitat loss can reduce the amount of suitable habitat available for many species, making it difficult for
            them to survive and reproduce. Overexploitation can lead to the depletion of wild populations, making it
            difficult for them to recover. Climate change can cause species to migrate or go extinct, disrupting the
            delicate balance of ecosystems. Pollution, invasive species, and disease can all have negative impacts on
            biodiversity by altering the physical or biological environment in which species live.

        <h1>2. Species most under threat of extinction</h1>
        <p>
            The chart above shows which species are considered to be most at risk of extinction, according to the
            International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species.

            The IUCN evaluates 140,000 species by population and how they have changed over time, and creates a Red List
            Index of relative survival probability.

            An ancient group of plants known as cycads are most under threat and corals are the fastest declining of
            species
            that have been assessed at least twice.

            There are many species under threat of extinction, and the causes of their decline are often complex and
            interconnected. However, some species are considered to be at a particularly high risk of extinction, based
            on
            various factors such as their population size, habitat requirements, and the threats they face from human
            activities.

            One example of a species that is currently under threat of extinction is the vaquita, a small porpoise that
            is
            found only in the northern Gulf of California in Mexico. The vaquita has an estimated population of fewer
            than
            10 individuals, making it one of the rarest mammals in the world. The main threat to the vaquita is
            accidental
            entanglement in fishing nets, as it often swims in the same waters as the totoaba fish, which is also
            critically
            endangered and is illegally harvested for its swim bladder.

            Another example is the black rhinoceros, which is native to Africa and is currently classified as critically
            endangered. Poaching for their horns, which are highly valued in traditional medicine and as a status
            symbol,
            has caused a significant decline in black rhino populations over the past century. Habitat loss and
            fragmentation are also contributing to their decline.

            The mountain gorilla is another species that is under threat of extinction. Found in the mountainous regions
            of
            Uganda, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, mountain gorilla populations have declined due to
            habitat
            loss, poaching, and civil unrest in the region. However, conservation efforts have helped to stabilize their
            populations, and their numbers have increased in recent years.

            The leatherback sea turtle is also considered to be at high risk of extinction. The main threats to
            leatherbacks
            include accidental capture in fishing nets, hunting for their meat and eggs, and habitat loss due to coastal
            development and pollution. Climate change is also affecting the temperature of the sand on beaches where
            leatherbacks lay their eggs, which can negatively impact their survival.

            These are just a few examples of the many species that are currently under threat of extinction. It is
            important
            to recognize that each species faces unique challenges and that conservation efforts must be tailored to
            their
            specific needs. However, it is clear that human activities such as habitat destruction, overexploitation,
            and
            climate change are driving many species towards extinction, highlighting the urgent need for action to
            protect
            biodiversity and the services it provides to humans.

        <h1>3. Where biodiversity is most intact</h1>
        <p>
            The Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) estimates how much of an area’s natural biodiversity remains,
            helping us to understand past, current and future changes to nature, write Andy Purvis, of London’s Natural
            History Museum and Samantha Hill, of the UN Environment Programme’s World Conservation Monitoring Centre.

            In the map above, the darkest areas indicate those with a BII of between 90-100%, where the area has “enough
            biodiversity to be a resilient and functioning ecosystem”.

            At the lightest end of the spectrum, the pale orange and yellow-shaded areas indicate a BII of less than
            30%, which means the biodiversity has been “depleted and the ecosystem could be at risk of collapse”.

            Some of the most intact areas of biodiversity can be found in tropical rainforests, such as the Amazon
            Basin, the Congo Basin, and the Southeast Asian archipelago. These regions are known for their incredible
            diversity of plant and animal species, many of which are found nowhere else on Earth. Coral reefs are also
            important centers of biodiversity, as they support a vast array of marine species and provide critical
            habitat for many fish species.

            Other areas of high biodiversity include savannas, deserts, and temperate forests, as well as freshwater
            ecosystems such as rivers, lakes, and wetlands. These areas provide important ecosystem services, such as
            water purification, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration, and are critical for maintaining the health
            and well-being of both human societies and natural ecosystems.

            Despite the importance of these areas, many of them are under threat from human activities such as
            deforestation, overfishing, pollution, and climate change. As a result, there is growing recognition of the
            need to protect and conserve these areas, both for their intrinsic value and for the benefits they provide
            to human societies. This includes efforts to establish protected areas, promote sustainable land use
            practices, and reduce the impacts of climate change and other environmental threats.

        <h1>4. Humanity’s ecological footprint</h1>
        <p>
            In 2020, we overused our planet’s resources by at least 75%, or the equivalent to living off 1.75 Earths,
            according to the Global Footprint Network.

            This is a measure of our Ecological Footprint, the demand humans put on Earth’s “biocapacity” - or the
            ability of ecosystems to regenerate.

            The above chart shows that almost two-thirds (60%) of our Ecological Footprint is made up of our carbon
            footprint, which measures the emissions we generate from burning fossil fuels producing cement by converting
            them into “forest areas needed to sequester the emissions not absorbed by oceans”.

            The ecological footprint of humanity has grown dramatically over the past few centuries, driven by factors
            such as population growth, urbanization, industrialization, and globalization. Today, humans are using
            natural resources and generating waste and pollution at a rate that exceeds the Earth's ability to replenish
            and absorb them, leading to a range of environmental problems such as climate change, biodiversity loss, and
            water scarcity.

            There are many ways to measure the ecological footprint of humanity, but one common approach is to calculate
            the amount of land and water required to produce the goods and services consumed by humans, as well as the
            amount of land and water required to absorb the waste and pollution generated by human activities. This can
            be expressed in terms of global hectares (gha), which is a standardized measure of biologically productive
            land and water.

            The ecological footprint of humanity is a complex issue that requires a multifaceted solution. This includes
            reducing consumption and waste, promoting sustainable production and consumption patterns, investing in
            renewable energy and green technologies, protecting and restoring natural ecosystems, and addressing social
            and economic inequalities that contribute to environmental degradation. Ultimately, it requires a
            fundamental shift in the way we live, work, and interact with the natural world, in order to create a more
            sustainable and equitable future for all.

        <h1>5. Bending the curve on biodiversity loss</h1>
        <img src="images/5.jpg" alt="img5" height="450px" width="55%" align="right">
        <p>Recovery is possible, as the above chart shows, but bending the curve for biodiversity will require ambitious
            targets that not only accelerate conservation and restoration, but also address drivers of biodiversity
            loss.

            The report says these include more sustainable production and consumption practices, such as: “sustainable
            increases in yield and trade, reduction of waste, and the adoption of a higher share of plant-based products
            in our diets” to limit the expansion of land use in future.

            Crucially, we cannot reduce the loss of biodiversity without keeping global warming below

            2°C (or preferably 1.5°C), which will need decarbonization at speed in all sectors, from energy to
            agriculture.

            "Bending the curve" on biodiversity loss refers to the urgent need to reverse the trend of global
            biodiversity decline by reducing the rate at which species are becoming extinct and ecosystems are being
            degraded. This concept was introduced by the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2010, recognizing that
            the current trajectory of biodiversity loss is unsustainable and threatens the well-being of both human
            societies and natural ecosystems.

            To bend the curve on biodiversity loss, a range of conservation and management measures must be employed.
            This includes protecting and restoring habitats, reducing the pressures on wildlife from overexploitation,
            pollution, and invasive species, and addressing the underlying drivers of biodiversity loss such as habitat
            destruction, climate change, and unsustainable land use practices.

            There is growing recognition of the need to take urgent action to bend the curve on biodiversity loss. This
            includes efforts to establish protected areas, promote sustainable land use practices, and reduce the
            impacts of climate change and other environmental threats. It also involves engaging stakeholders and
            communities in the conservation of biodiversity and integrating biodiversity considerations into
            decision-making processes at all levels.

            Achieving this goal will require a coordinated and collaborative effort from governments, civil society, the
            private sector, and individuals around the world. While there is no silver bullet solution, a combination of
            political will, technological innovation, and social change can help us to create a more sustainable and
            equitable future for all.
